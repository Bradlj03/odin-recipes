    <h1>Marry Me Chicken!!!</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken_dinner.jpeg" alt=" Marry me chicken dinner">

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <strong>Chicken breast</strong>
         sliced into cutlets. You literally just slice them in half to make them thinner. If you use whole chicken breasts, you’ll need to finish this off in the oven to make sure that they’re cooked through. But I like cutlets better in this recipe.
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <strong>Flour, salt, and pepper</strong>
        you will dredge the chicken in flour for that lovely golden and crispy crust.
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <strong>Olive oil and butter</strong>
        to brown the chicken I use olive oil and butter for flavor. You can even use the sundried tomato oil for extra flavor. That’s free flavor there!
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <strong>Garlic</strong>
        because it makes everything taste better!
    </ul>
       
       
    <ul>
        <strong>Chicken or vegetable stock</strong>
        I recommend using chicken stock, but if all you have available is vegetable

    </ul>

    <ul>
        <strong>Heavy cream and parmesan cheese</strong>
        for a super creamy and flavorful sauce. Do not use single or light cream as it won’t thicken the sauce very well.

    </ul>

    <ul>
        <strong>Chili flakes, dried oregano, and thyme</strong>
        for extra flavor
    </ul>
  
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>Dredge the chicken in seasoned flour, and shake off any excess flour. Transfer to a plate but do not stack the chicken as they will stick to each other.</ol>
    <ol>In a heavy-bottomed pan on medium heat, heat the oil and melt the butter.</ol>
    <ol>Brown the chicken on both sides until it’s golden brown, transfer onto a warm plate, cover, and set aside.</ol>
    <ol>Saute the garlic for a minute or until it’s fragrant. Add the chicken stock, and deglaze the pan scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the heavy cream and the parmesan cheese to the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes, then season with chili flakes and oregano.</ol>
    <ol> Season with salt and pepper to your taste, add the sundried tomatoes then put the chicken back in the sauce and let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few more minutes</ol>
